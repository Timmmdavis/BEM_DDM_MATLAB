% Test: Spherical chamber with internal pressure causing ground
% displacement
% 
% Solution: Lisowski, M., 2007. Analytical volcano deformation source
% models. In'Volcano Deformation'(pp. 279-304). Springer Berlin Heidelberg.
% Equation: 8.15. This is a simplified analytical equation for the
% deformation induced by a point source in a half space. This requires a
% finite 'magma chamber' or sphere. An internal pressure is specified and
% this inflates and displaces the ground surface. The solution is relative
% to 0,0 and in radial coordinates. For simplicity the comparison with the
% script uses a magma chamber placed at 0,0 and a strip of observation
% points are placed along the positive X axis. The radius used is 1 and the
% elastic constants are poisons ratio 0.25 and mu=1. These can be changed
% if needed.
%  
% Proof: This shows the half space solution works correctly for meshed 3d
% objects subject to user defined tractions on each element.

	% This follows the same unit convention as Poly3d so ''assumes dimensionally consistent units for physical quantities with
	% dimensions of length or stress. Thus if you use kilometers for any quantity with
	% dimensions of length (e.g. a coordinate position), you must use kilometers for all
	% quantities with dimensions of length (e.g. displacement discontinuity).''

	%Conventions: 
		%See figure 6.14 in David Pollards book for tensors. 
		%Geological convention is that a confining pressure is a positive stress. Geological convention is used throughout this script. 
		%For a normal stress: positive if it produces compression in the material.
		%For a shear stress: negative if, when acting on the + face identified by the first index, it points
		%in the + direction identified by the second index. Example: Exy is - if on the +x face it points
		%in the +y direction.
		%For example a positive value in shear stress Sxy will cause RightLateral movement.
		
		%Strain uses the same convention as engineering stress convention where extension is a positve value. When entering strain values remember this. 
		%For a normal stress: positive (negative) if it produces tension (compression) in the material.
		%For a shear stress: positive if, when acting on the + face identified by the first index, it points
		%in the + direction identified by the second index. Example: Exy is + if on the +x face it points
		%in the +y direction.
		%For example a positive value in shear strain Exy will cause Leftlateral movement.
