	%Script to run dislocations on a fault surface

	% This follows the same unit convention as Poly3d so ''assumes dimensionally consistent units for physical quantities with
	% dimensions of length or stress. Thus if you use kilometers for any quantity with
	% dimensions of length (e.g. a coordinate position), you must use kilometers for all
	% quantities with dimensions of length (e.g. displacement discontinuity).''
	% Andrew Lyell Thomas, Masters thesis, Stanford University. 

cmap = colormap_cpt('Ccool-warm'); %Loads a colourmap to be used for figures. This is Kenneth Morelands diverging colourmap.
cmap2 = colormap_cpt('Ccool-warm2');

	%Conventions: 
		%See figure 6.14 in David Pollards book for tensors. 
		%Geological convention is that a confining pressure is a positive stress. Geological convention is used throughout this script. 
		%For a normal stress: positive if it produces compression in the material.
		%For a shear stress: negative if, when acting on the + face identified by the first index, it points
		%in the + direction identified by the second index. Example: Exy is - if on the +x face it points
		%in the +y direction.
		%For example a positive value in shear stress Sxy will cause RightLateral movement.
		
		%Strain uses the same convention as engineering stress convention where extension is a positve value. When entering strain values remember this. 
		%For a normal stress: positive (negative) if it produces tension (compression) in the material.
		%For a shear stress: positive if, when acting on the + face identified by the first index, it points
		%in the + direction identified by the second index. Example: Exy is + if on the +x face it points
		%in the +y direction.
		%For example a positive value in shear strain Exy will cause Leftlateral movement.
		
	%Precision:
		%Due to the fairly large nature of some models your machine may run out of memory. Simplicity is key when getting to know your model before 
		%increasing the complexity and sampling. 
		%In functions that are creating large arrays the precision has been reduced to 'single' in this script. See example below. Remove the word 'single' if you need a higher precision.
		%From the MATLAB help - ''Use double-precision to store values greater than approximately 3.4 x 10^38 or less than approximately -3.4 x 10^38. 
		%For numbers that lie between these two limits , you can use either double- or single-precision, but single requires less memory.''
		%Preferably you would change your units /models scale before increasing the precision and doubling the memory usage.
