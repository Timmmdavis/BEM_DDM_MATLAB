% University Press. eq 4.74 3d Analytical solution for the relative
% displacement/slip across a flat circular crack under a remote load. Both
% the shear and normal displacements are calculated. For the TDE solution
% the calculated displacements are converted to radial coordinates so 'r'
% is the distance form the crack centre. These are then plotted against the
% analytical solution.
% 
% Proof: This tests that the remote stress function is calculating the
% correct displacements across the cracks face. its quite slow even for a
% fairly low sampling ~14 mid points in each radial 16th of the circle
% (pi/8 rad). The match gets better with increased sampling much like in 2d
% BEM models.

	% This follows the same unit convention as Poly3d so ''assumes dimensionally consistent units for physical quantities with
	% dimensions of length or stress. Thus if you use kilometers for any quantity with
	% dimensions of length (e.g. a coordinate position), you must use kilometers for all
	% quantities with dimensions of length (e.g. displacement discontinuity).''

	%Conventions: 
		%See figure 6.14 in David Pollards book for tensors. 
		%Geological convention is that a confining pressure is a positive stress. Geological convention is used throughout this script. 
		%For a normal stress: positive if it produces compression in the material.
		%For a shear stress: negative if, when acting on the + face identified by the first index, it points
		%in the + direction identified by the second index. Example: Exy is - if on the +x face it points
		%in the +y direction.
		%For example a positive value in shear stress Sxy will cause RightLateral movement.
		
		%Strain uses the same convention as engineering stress convention where extension is a positve value. When entering strain values remember this. 
		%For a normal stress: positive (negative) if it produces tension (compression) in the material.
		%For a shear stress: positive if, when acting on the + face identified by the first index, it points
		%in the + direction identified by the second index. Example: Exy is + if on the +x face it points
		%in the +y direction.
		%For example a positive value in shear strain Exy will cause Leftlateral movement.
