%Test: 2d Planar fracture with increasing frictional profile: Comparison of
% slip distributions along a planar fracture with linearly increasing
% friction (sliding friction/frictional strength) from 0 at the centre to a
% set value at the tips.
% Also testing slip reduces with normal stress (mu). Havent yet found a
% analytical solution for this.
% 
% Solution: From Burgmann, R., Pollard, D.D. and Martel, S.J., 1994. Slip
% distributions on faults: effects of stress gradients, inelastic
% deformation, heterogeneous host-rock stiffness, and fault interaction.
% Journal of Structural Geology, 16(12), pp.1675-1690. This test calculates
% the analytical slip profile for a planar fracture with its friction
% increasing linearly to its tips. This fracture is subjected to a set
% shear stress. In the code a planar fracture lying along the X axis is
% loaded with a shear stress (Sxy) with 100 elements where each has its own
% set frictional strength. The shearing slip distribution is calculated.
% Checks the residual value is smaller than a threshold.  Res=Slip from
% solver ' Slip from solution.
% 
% Proof: This shows the frictional properties for each element in the code
% is working correctly. It shows with enough elements this results in a
% accurate slip profile for a fracture with friction. This does not need to
% test the resultant stress in the surrounding material as this is
% dependant on each slip contribution and is accurate as shown in the other
% tests.


% Setup: I have put this into 2 parts each with two subparts. Firstly I run
% a tall vertical fracture under Sxy and check it matches the analytical
% slip profile for its strike slip shearing. Secondly I check this fractures
% slip is reduced with a normal stress.
% Third and fourth I run the same two tests but for a flat lying fracture
% long in YY that is loaded under shearing Sxz. For this I check the dip
% slip shearing not strike slip.

	%Conventions: 
		%See figure 6.14 in David Pollards book for tensors. 
		%Geological convention is that a confining pressure is a positive stress. Geological convention is used throughout this script. 
		%For a normal stress: positive if it produces compression in the material.
		%For a shear stress: negative if, when acting on the + face identified by the first index, it points
		%in the + direction identified by the second index. Example: Exy is - if on the +x face it points
		%in the +y direction.
		%For example a positive value in shear stress Sxy will cause RightLateral movement.
		
		%Strain uses the same convention as engineering stress convention where extension is a positve value. When entering strain values remember this. 
		%For a normal stress: positive (negative) if it produces tension (compression) in the material.
		%For a shear stress: positive if, when acting on the + face identified by the first index, it points
		%in the + direction identified by the second index. Example: Exy is + if on the +x face it points
		%in the +y direction.
		%For example a positive value in shear strain Exy will cause Leftlateral movement.
