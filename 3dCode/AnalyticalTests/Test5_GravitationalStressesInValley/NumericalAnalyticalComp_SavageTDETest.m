% Test: Gravitational unloading stresses after erosion of a valley into an
% elastic medium
% 
% Solution: Coded a MATLAB version of the FORTRAN code for the analytical
% solution. This code is from: Savage, William Z., Philip S. Powers, and
% Henri S. Swolfs. In situ geomechanics of crystalline and sedimentary
% rocks; Part V, RVT, a Fortran program for an exact elastic solution for
% tectonics and gravity stresses in isolated symmetric ridges and valleys.
% No. 84-827. US Geological Survey,, 1984. This runs through the Savage
% code calculating the stresses at points below the valley. A surface is
% loaded that reflects this 2d valley profile at Y=0 and extends far in
% either Y direction with the same profile. The weight of the material is
% set to 1. A plot is drawn of for the analytical and BEM solution along
% Y=0. The test checks the mean residual stress is below 0.01mpa.
% 
% Proof: This tests the implementation of the elastic stresses due to
% topography as described in Martel and Muller 2000.

	% This follows the same unit convention as Poly3d so ''assumes dimensionally consistent units for physical quantities with
	% dimensions of length or stress. Thus if you use kilometers for any quantity with
	% dimensions of length (e.g. a coordinate position), you must use kilometers for all
	% quantities with dimensions of length (e.g. displacement discontinuity).''

	%Conventions: 
		%See figure 6.14 in David Pollards book for tensors. 
		%Geological convention is that a confining pressure is a positive stress. Geological convention is used throughout this script. 
		%For a normal stress: positive if it produces compression in the material.
		%For a shear stress: negative if, when acting on the + face identified by the first index, it points
		%in the + direction identified by the second index. Example: Exy is - if on the +x face it points
		%in the +y direction.
		%For example a positive value in shear stress Sxy will cause RightLateral movement.
		
		%Strain uses the same convention as engineering stress convention where extension is a positve value. When entering strain values remember this. 
		%For a normal stress: positive (negative) if it produces tension (compression) in the material.
		%For a shear stress: positive if, when acting on the + face identified by the first index, it points
		%in the + direction identified by the second index. Example: Exy is + if on the +x face it points
		%in the +y direction.
		%For example a positive value in shear strain Exy will cause Leftlateral movement.
