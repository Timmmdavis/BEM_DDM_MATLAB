% This test checks the estimated stress intensity for two 3D problems,
% firstly a curved crack subject to biaxial stress (2D plane strain
% problem) and then a inclined penny shaped crack that is subject to
% uniaxial tension. This checks that both problems are within a tolerance
% (assuming the elastic parmeters have not changed).

% loads. Journal of engineering mathematics, 49(1), pp.1-18.

% disk-shaped domain integral method for the computation of stress

%Conventions:
%
% This follows the same unit convention as Poly3d so ''assumes
% dimensionally consistent units for physical quantities with
% dimensions of length or stress. Thus if you use kilometers for any
% quantity with dimensions of length (e.g. a coordinate position), you
% must use kilometers for all quantities with dimensions of length
% (e.g. displacement discontinuity).'' Andrew Lyell Thomas, Masters
% thesis, Stanford University.
%
% Engineering stress convention is used in this script for both tensors
% and principal stresses. S1 is the LEAST compressive stress. 
% See figure 6.13 & 6.14 in Pollard and Fletcher 2005.
