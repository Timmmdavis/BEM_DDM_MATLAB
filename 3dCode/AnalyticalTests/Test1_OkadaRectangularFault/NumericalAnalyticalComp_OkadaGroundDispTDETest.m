% Test: Rectangular fault slip causing ground surface displacement
% 
% Solution: Okada, Y., 1985. Surface deformation due to shear and tensile
% faults in a half-space. Bulletin of the seismological society of
% America, 75(4), pp.1135-1154. Code for this written in MATLAB by François
% Beauducel :
% http://uk.mathworks.com/MATLABcentral/fileexchange/25982-okada--surface-deformation-due-to-a-finite-rectangular-source
% A fault that matches the one used in the Okada code is made from two
% triangles in the TDE code. A dipslip displacement 1 is used and the
% ground surface displaced. It checks that all ground surface displacements
% are within 1e-8 figures. The fault is at a different orientation to the
% Cartesian axes: a dip of 70 and azimuth of 150.
% 
% Proof: This shows the superposition is working correctly and the original
% M Nikko TDE functions have not changed. These were independently tested
% agasit Okada in the original TDE solution paper.
