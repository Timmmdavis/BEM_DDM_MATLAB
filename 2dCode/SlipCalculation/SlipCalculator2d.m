%   Influence Coefficient functions from:
%   "Boundary element methods in Solid Mechanics"
%   by S.L. Crouch and A.M. Starfield, 1983

%
%   INPUTS
%   x & y are element midpoints
%   xe & ye are also element midpoints, the coefficients function looks at
%   how each xe affects each x etc. 
%   a is an array of each each elements half length
%   Beta is the orientation of each element relative to the X axis in the
%   C&S convention (See C&S section 2.8 p22 for Beta definition)
%   Pxx, Pyy & Pxy are the stress inputs
%   nu is the Poisson's ratio
%   E is the Young's modulus
%   mu is the shear modulus
%   halfspace defines if we work out the coefficientsin a half or whole
%   space
%   NUM is the number of elements
%   NormAng is now the outward normal measured from Xaxis counter
%   clockwise to the normal
%   Pxx,Pyy,Pxy,Tn,Ts are the defined stresses or tractions at the
%   elements, either defined for each element or just a single value that
%   will then be added to all elements.
%   strain is a flag that means remote stress are actually strains, these
%   are converted to stresses before this continues. 
%   Fdisp, flag of elements that have fixed displacements. Displacement
%   coefficients are created if this exists and the system of linear
%   equations changes. 
%   Mu, Coefficient of friction
%   Sf, Sliding friction
%   Option - which option the user is using. 
    %B=under remote stress, fault can interpenetrate
    %C=friction solver as in ritz 2012
    %D=remote stress, opening components not calculated. Fault satisfys
    %boundary conditions by shearing only.
    %E=tractions defined on body, Ie pressure in a magma chamber
    %F=Inhomogeneous
