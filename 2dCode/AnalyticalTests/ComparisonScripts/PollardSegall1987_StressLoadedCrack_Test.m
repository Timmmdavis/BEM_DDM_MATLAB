% Test: Fracture loaded with remote stress: Comparison of slip
% distributions along a planar fracture loaded remotely. Also compares the
% induced stresses in a surrounding grid of observation points.
% 
% Solution: Pollard, D.D. and Segall, P., 1987. Theoretical displacements
% and stresses near fractures in rock: with applications to faults, joints,
% veins, dikes, and solution surfaces.'Fracture mechanics of rock,277(349),
% pp.277-349. This solution is an analytical solution using complex stress
% functions. It loads a planar 2d fracture again lying along the X axis
% with far field stress Sxx, Syy or Sxy. It calculates the slip
% distribution and induced Cartesian stress components for points
% surrounding the fracture. To quote Steve Martel on this complex stress
% method ''They also have a key advantage over numerical methods such as
% constant displacement-discontinuity boundary element techniques (Crouch
% and Starfield, 1974) in that the stresses and displacements can be
% calculated at points arbitrarily close to the patch walls.''. This can be
% seen in the results where the DDM methods match is less accurate closer
% to the fault. Especially near the tips where the slip distribution should
% increases exponentially and the DDM is blocky. This test compares both
% the residual slip and residual stress in the points for the maximum
% deviation from the analytical solution. This test drives displacement
% with a tensile stress but this is set up so the user could change to a
% driving shear stress is they need. Comparative figures are also plotted.
% 
% Proof: This gives a good idea that the influence matrix collation and
% linear equations are working correctly. It also allows for an estimation
% of sampling needed before the solution is accurate enough. There are
% plenty of papers on TWODDs accuracy already. As the workflow given by
% Crouch and Starfield has changed in my code and it's  a new code base it's
% a good proof of the basics.
