% Test: Test shows how to run with multiple elastic bodies and that this is setup to work
% correctly. A hole with an internal pressure is sits in the centre of a
% ring with elastic property 1. This ring sits inside a matrix of elastic property 2. 
% A solution is calculated and the radial stresses at all points within an observation grid
% are calculated. 
% 
% Solution: Crouch, S.L. and Starfield, A.M., 1982. Boundary element methods in solid 
% mechanics: with applications in rock mechanics and geological engineering. Allen & Unwin.
%  
% Proof: This tests that this has been correctly implemented and is the
% correct methodology for multiple elastics. A slightly cleaner formulation
% (restructured) could be used but this is a good starting point.
