% Test: Check to see if the results from a flat dislocation lying in the half space is the same coming out of the 3d and 2d code. Runs on a planar fracture lying in X -1 to 1  and 25m below ground surface and checks the displacements along Y=0 X=0-100 
% 
% Solution: The 3d code for a single triangle is the analytical solution of Nikkhoo, M. and Walter, T.R., 2015. Triangular dislocation: an analytical, artefact-free solution.Geophysical Journal International,'201(2), pp.1117-1139
% I am using 4 triangles for the fault plane but these are meshed correctly so the results will not change
% Comparing this to the 2d code requires that we extend the fault along the Y axis far enough that end affects of non plain strain components don't mess with the '2d observations' result. I have extended the fault 500m in either direction along Y. The displacement is 0.01m to avoid the infinitesimal strain breaking down. 
% 
% Proof: This test that the HS solution is correct for the crack in 2d as this code is from disparate parts of the Crouch and Starfield book and is not explicitly written. Steve Martel provided an excellent base code for the 2d hs solution to start from.
