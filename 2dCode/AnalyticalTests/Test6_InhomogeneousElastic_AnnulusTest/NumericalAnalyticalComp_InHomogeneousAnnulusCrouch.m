% Test: Test shows how to run with multiple elastic bodies and that this is setup to work
% correctly. A hole with an internal pressure is sits in the centre of a
% ring with elastic property 1. This ring sits inside a matrix of elastic property 2. 
% A solution is calculated and the radial stresses at all points within an observation grid
% are calculated. 
% 
% Solution: Crouch, S.L. and Starfield, A.M., 1982. Boundary element methods in solid 
% mechanics: with applications in rock mechanics and geological engineering. Allen & Unwin.
%  
% Proof: This tests that this has been correctly implemented and is the
% correct methodology for multiple elastics. A slightly cleaner formulation
% (restructured) could be used but this is a good starting point. 

%   Copyright 2017, Tim Davis, The University of Aberdeen

% To Do: 
% Check if removing observation points a certain distance from the radial
% tips fixes spurious stress values.

	% This follows the same unit convention as Poly3d so ''assumes dimensionally consistent units for physical quantities with
	% dimensions of length or stress. Thus if you use kilometers for any quantity with
	% dimensions of length (e.g. a coordinate position), you must use kilometers for all
	% quantities with dimensions of length (e.g. displacement discontinuity).''

	%Conventions: 
		%See figure 6.14 in David Pollards book for tensors. 
		%Geological convention is that a confining pressure is a positive stress. Geological convention is used throughout this script. 
		%For a normal stress: positive if it produces compression in the material.
		%For a shear stress: negative if, when acting on the + face identified by the first index, it points
		%in the + direction identified by the second index. Example: Exy is - if on the +x face it points
		%in the +y direction.
		%For example a positive value in shear stress Sxy will cause RightLateral movement.
		
		%Strain uses the same convention as engineering stress convention where extension is a positve value. When entering strain values remember this. 
		%For a normal stress: positive (negative) if it produces tension (compression) in the material.
		%For a shear stress: positive if, when acting on the + face identified by the first index, it points
		%in the + direction identified by the second index. Example: Exy is + if on the +x face it points
		%in the +y direction.
		%For example a positive value in shear strain Exy will cause Leftlateral movement.
