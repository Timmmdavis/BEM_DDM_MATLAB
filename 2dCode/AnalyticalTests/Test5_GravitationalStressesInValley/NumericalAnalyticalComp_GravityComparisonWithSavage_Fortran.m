% Test: Gravitational unloading stresses after erosion of a valley into an
% elastic medium: Checks to see if the script can reproduce solutions for
% stresses caused by a valley profile in an elastic medium.
% 
% Solution: Coded a MATLAB version of the FORTRAN code for the analytical
% solution. This code is from: Savage, William Z., Philip S. Powers, and
% Henri S. Swolfs. In situ geomechanics of crystalline and sedimentary
% rocks; Part V, RVT, a Fortran program for an exact elastic solution for
% tectonics and gravity stresses in isolated symmetric ridges and valleys.
% No. 84-827. US Geological Survey,, 1984. This runs through the Savage
% code calculating the stresses at points below the valley. These points
% are then passed to the gravitational stress code using the parameters set
% up in the savage part. The weight of the material is set to 1. A plot is
% drawn of for the analytical and BEM solution. The test checks the mean
% residual stress is below 0.01mpa.
%  
% Proof: This tests the implementation of the elastic stresses due to
% topography as described in Martel and Muller 2000.
