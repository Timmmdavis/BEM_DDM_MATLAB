% Test: Hole with internal pressure: Compares stresses around a hole with
% an internal pressure that sits in an infinite elastic.
% 
% Solution: Used the script for this from the Pollard and Fletcher
% fundamentals book. This solution is In most elasticity/continuum
% textbooks as its simple to implement and relevant. Itâÿÿs the original
% solution from: Kirsch, G., 1898. Theory of Elasticity and Application in
% Strength of Materials.Â Zeits chrift des Vereins Deutscher
% Ingenieure,Â 42(29), pp.797-807. The solution is independent of elastic
% constants and hole size, it only relies on the input pressure. Elastic
% constants will only change the displacement related to the pressure. The
% results in the surrounding grid from the analytical and code solution are
% compared and this checks the residual stresses are not too high. Figures
% are also drawn that can be compared.
%  
% Proof: This tests the user defined traction function works and reproduces
% the result. This gives a good example case for using it. Displacement
% components could also be compared in this test. These were not in the
% original solution so for the sake of simplicity have been omitted. The
% solutions are here if needed:
