% Test: Constant shear dislocation: Comparison of stresses and
% displacements in an observation grid surrounding a flat lying dislocation
% with a constant shearing discontinuity (Glide dislocation).
% 
% Solution: Stresses induced in the surrounding medium are given by the
% formulas for a glide dislocation from Barber, J., 2010. Elasticity (ed.,
% Vol. 172).(G. Gladwell, Ed.) Michigan. Displacements are found using
% equations 8.63-8.37 from Pollard, D.D. and Fletcher, R.C.,
% 2005.Fundamentals of structural geology. Cambridge University Press.
% (these displacement equations are originally from Weertman and Weertman
% 1964) . This solution uses the superposition of two analytical solutions
% for dislocations extending to infinity from a point in a whole space. The
% residual stress and displacement at each observation point is calculated
% and this throws an error if this is too high.
% 
% Proof: Each element in the 2d TWODD code is essentially this solution
% underneath but with coordinate transformations to get Cartesian stress
% components that are dependant on the elements orientation. Comparing the
% code to the analytical solution gives a good idea that the basic TWODD
% maths is correctly coded for a constant dislocation. its a basic test and
% only really shows the calculations are correct when not having to use the
% complex TWODD maths for the coordinate transformations.
