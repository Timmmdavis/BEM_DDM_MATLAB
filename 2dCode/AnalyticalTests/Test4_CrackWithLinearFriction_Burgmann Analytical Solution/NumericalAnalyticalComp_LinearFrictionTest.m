% Test: Planar fracture with increasing frictional profile: Comparison of
% slip distributions along a planar fracture with linearly increasing
% friction (sliding friction/frictional strength) from 0 at the centre to a
% set value at the tips.
% 
% Solution: From Burgmann, R., Pollard, D.D. and Martel, S.J., 1994. Slip
% distributions on faults: effects of stress gradients, inelastic
% deformation, heterogeneous host-rock stiffness, and fault interaction.
% Journal of Structural Geology, 16(12), pp.1675-1690. This test calculates
% the analytical slip profile for a planar fracture with its friction
% increasing linearly to its tips. This fracture is subjected to a set
% shear stress. In the code a planar fracture lying along the X axis is
% loaded with a shear stress (Sxy) with 100 elements where each has its own
% set frictional strength. The shearing slip distribution is calculated.
% Checks the residual value is smaller than a threshold.  Res=Slip from
% solver ' Slip from solution.
% 
% Proof: This shows the frictional properties for each element in the code
% is working correctly. It shows with enough elements this results in a
% accurate slip profile for a fracture with friction. This does not need to
% test the resultant stress in the surrounding material as this is
% dependant on each slip contribution and is accurate as shown in the other
% tests.
