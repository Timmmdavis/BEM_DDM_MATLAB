% usage #1:
% [ Ds,Dn ] = LinearCompFrictionSolver2d(D,A,Sf,Mu,ne,TnDr,TsDr)
%
% Arguments: (input)
% D                 - Element displacements calculated normally, i.e. these
%                     can interpenetrate. First half of this col vector is
%                     normal disp and the second is shear. 
%
% A                 - Typical 2D DDM BEM influence matrix. 
%
% Sf                - Either list or single value of the cohesion (sliding
%                     friction) at every element.
%
% Mu                - Either list or single value of the coefficient of
%                     friction on every element.
%
% ne                - Number of elements.
%
% TnDr              - The normal traction at each element (remote stress). 
% 
% TsDr              - The shear traction at each element (remote stress). 
%
%
% Arguments: (output)
% Ds,Dn             - The shear and normal displacement at every element
%                     including frictional constraints.

% Another way to get [C], Slower but more intuitive.
% Z=zeros((NUM*2),1);
% for i=1:(NUM*2)
% Z=Z*0;

%Therefore each col in [C] represents how much each 
%element must displace to cause a traction
%of one unit at element i.
